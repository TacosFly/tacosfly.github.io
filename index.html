<h2>Almost 2024</h2><br>

This is the first day of my blog. I made this as a sort of New Years resolution, because I was seeing projects online where people had
documented their lives over long periods of time in several ways, and I wanted to have a way of remembering my life after a long period
of time. There were a few projects online that I saw, some notable ones being Cary Huang's photo every day for 8 years, where he took
one photo of himself with a card with a short note about that day every day for 8 years, or a YouTube channel I stumbled across yesterday
where a man made a short, 20 second vlog every day for around 7 years, which is still continuous. So, this is why I decided to start my 
blog. Today is quite a cool day for summer, around 26 degrees currently at 11am. The weather is forecast for storms, however the blue 
skies doesn't make it seem like that's going to happen anytime soon. As I write this, I'm calling with my partner who's about to go
to Melbourne. She says it's going to be so cold, but since it's summer, it's probably only going to be about as cold as it is here in 
winter, if not a bit colder. <br>
I'm typing on my new Keychron V1 keyboard that I got for Christmas, which I like a lot. <br>

I've put KTT Grapefruit switches in it, and replaced most of the keys with a rainbow POM Jelly keycap set I have. I think it looks pretty 
good. The spacebar has a small amount of ticking, but its pretty unnoticeable. This keyboard is a small upgrade from the Vissles V84 I had 
before. I would recommend this to anyone starting to get into custom mechanical keyboards.
