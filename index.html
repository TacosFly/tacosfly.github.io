<h2>Almost 2024</h2><br>
<i>31/12/2023 • 12:06 PM AEST</i><br>
This is the first day of my blog. I made this as a sort of New Years resolution, because I was seeing projects online where people had
documented their lives over long periods of time in several ways, and I wanted to have a way of remembering my life after a long period
of time. There were a few projects online that I saw, some notable ones being Cary Huang's photo every day for 8 years, where he took
one photo of himself with a card with a short note about that day every day for 8 years, or a YouTube channel I stumbled across yesterday
where a man made a short, 20 second vlog every day for around 7 years, which is still continuous. So, this is why I decided to start my 
blog. Today is quite a cool day for summer, around 26 degrees currently at 11am. The weather is forecast for storms, however the blue 
skies doesn't make it seem like that's going to happen anytime soon. As I write this, I'm calling with my partner who's about to go
to Melbourne. She says it's going to be so cold, but since it's summer, it's probably only going to be about as cold as it is here in 
winter, if not a bit colder. <br>
I'm typing on my new Keychron V1 keyboard that I got for Christmas, which I like a lot. <br>

<br>
I've put KTT Grapefruit switches in it, and replaced most of the keys with a rainbow POM Jelly keycap set I have. I think it looks pretty 
good. The spacebar has a small amount of ticking, but its pretty unnoticeable. This keyboard is a small upgrade from the Vissles V84 I had 
before. I would recommend this to anyone starting to get into custom mechanical keyboards.

<h2>It's the New Year!</h2><br>
<i>2/01/2024 • 2:31 PM AEST</i>
I'm writing this for the third time because I forgot to save it.
<br>
It's 2024! This year is a leap year, meaning that there will be a February 29th. Yay? This year, having 366 days as it does reminds me of 
an interesting Microsoft Excel bug where the program believes that the 29th of February 1900 was a real day. This is false, as 1900 was 
not a leap year. This is because a year divisible by 100 is only a leap year if it is also divisible by 400, defined by the Gregorian 
Calendar that we all use. Thanks to Microsoft's dedication to backwards compatibility, they can't change this glitch, because they
would risk breaking some extremely important spreadsheet somewhere in the world.

2 weeks ago, a game I have a lot of playtime in, Geometry Dash released its 2.2 update after 7 years of being on the 2.1 update. This 
update was, to say the least, enormous. This update added new gamemodes, levels, maps, gauntlets, icons, colours, and even a new 
level type called 'platformer'. The base game added a new level, 'Dash', and a new platformer level collection 'The Tower'. Below is an 
image from 'Dash'.

Yeah, it definitely looks interesting. I started by playing a difficult, Celeste-inspired platformer level called 'Coaster Mountain' by 
a creator named Serponge. This level looked and played really incredibly well, and while it was difficult, it only took me around an hour 
to beat it. Then, I played the base game levels and then the new gauntlet levels. They were really impressive, and I'm sure more 
content is going to be added soon into Geometry Dash.

Yesterday, me and my dad set up and fixed the bikes that we had. I had a sudden inspiration to ride bikes all of a sudden (because it's 
the school holidays and I don't have much to do), so I took the bikes out of the garage and me and my dad put the wheels back on and fixed 
some of the broken gears.

Yeah, it was raining all day, and has been for the last week, and probably will for the next week. That's just Australian summer for you.
